## Multi Agent Pathfinding!  It's pathfinding, but for multiple agents. ##

# Instructions for use #

Inside the **Build** folder is an executable file which will run the most recent version of the program.  If you want to edit it yourself, open the repository in Unity Hub 2022.3

Once the program is running, use left click to direct the drones on where to go.  Hold down Z to place obstacles, and hold down X to remove them.  Currently, the program does not support editing obstacles while pathfinding, so try to only edit the map while nothing is moving.
